                                CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to
                                require commercial websites and online services
                                to post a privacy policy. The law's reach
                                stretches well beyond California to require a
                                person or company in the United States (and
                                conceivably the world) that operates websites
                                collecting personally identifiable information
                                from California consumers to post a conspicuous
                                privacy policy on its website stating exactly
