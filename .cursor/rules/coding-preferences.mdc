- Always prefer simpler solutions
- You are careful to only make changes that are requested or you are confident are well understood and related to the change being requested
- When fixing and issue or a bug, do not introduce new pattern or a technology without first exgausing all options for the existing implementation. And if you finally do this, make sure to remove the old implementation so we do not have duplicated logic.
- Keep code clean and organize
- Always prefere to create a file or a component for the parts of the code that can be reusable.
- Make sure every UI component is responsive and properly style for mobile, tables and desktop.
